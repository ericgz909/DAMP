# DAMP
Mathematica Notebooks and Python Code for computations related to the Dynamical Axion Misalignment Production project.

The mathematica file 'axion enhancement.nb' was written by Eric Gonzalez and Raymond T. Co to calculate the dark matter relic abundance of axion produced by the DAMP mechanism, found in the publications https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11186 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11192

The mathematica file 'higgsosc.nb' was written by Eric Gonzalez and Raymond T. Co to calcualte energy density of the higgs field, as well as its decays to radiation/contribution to thermal bath in the DAMP mechanism. Novel interactions between the axion and higgs field are found due to the dynamics of the higgs potential modified by a hubble induced mass.

The python file 'PIMA.py' was written by Eric Gonzalez to numerically reproduce the results of the mathematica notebook 'axion enhancement.nb'
